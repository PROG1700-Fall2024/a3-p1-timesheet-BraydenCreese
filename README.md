Program 1 – Time Sheet

Design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on each of five work days from the user, then displays different information calculated about those entries as output. 
Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of how to apply list/loop concepts in a program that should:
•	Prompt the user to enter the five daily hours worked amounts and store them in the program. 
•	Determine the day(s) on which the most hours were worked and display the day(s) and hours onscreen. 
•	Calculate and display both the total and the daily average of hours worked.
•	Display a list of all days that had insufficient hours, which is defined as less than 7 hours.

Your solution must contain examples demonstrating your understanding of appropriate use of functions and core assignment concepts (loops and lists).
